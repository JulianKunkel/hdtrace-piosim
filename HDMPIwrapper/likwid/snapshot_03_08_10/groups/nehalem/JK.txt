Formulas:
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(UNC_QMC_NORMAL_READS_ANY+UNC_QMC_WRITES_FULL_ANY)*64/time
Remote Read BW [MBytes/s] =  1.0E-06*(UNC_QHL_REQUESTS_REMOTE_READS)*64/time;
DP MFlops/s =  (FP_COMP_OPS_EXE_SSE_FP_PACKED*2 +  FP_COMP_OPS_EXE_SSE_FP_SCALAR)/ runtime
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_REF)/inverseClock

This group gives you the actual core frequency in the measured time period. This is 
important because due to Speedstep and Turbo mode the frequency can vary significantly.
+
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
This group will be measured by one core per socket. The Remote  Read BW  tells you if
cachelines are transfered between sockets, meaning that cores access data owned by a remote
NUMA domain.
+
The Nehalem has not possibility to measure MFlops if mixed precision calculations are done.
Therefore both Single as well as Double precision are measured to ensure the correctness
of the measurements. You can check if your code was vectorized on the number of
FP_COMP_OPS_EXE_SSE_FP_PACKED versus the  FP_COMP_OPS_EXE_SSE_FP_SCALAR.
