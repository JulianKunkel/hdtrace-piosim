\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}
The communication is one of big time consuming factors of MPI applications.
Tracing the communication is one of the most common ways to visualize it,
find certain patterns and delays. % ?
PIOsimHD is a toolset that provides tracing and writes out the traces in files,
simulating a virtual environment for real MPI applications and visualizing the
communication. HDReplay adds the functionality of replaying the communication of
a traced MPI application by replaying the trace file. This gives you the
possibility to replay the communication and simulate the computation on
different hardware without recompiling the application.



\subsection{Tracing MPI Applications}
\label{tracing}
The trace file is generated by the HDMPIwrapper, a library that can be used to
log MPI function calls which occur during the execution of a program. Every 
MPI-rank has its own trace file containing the executed MPI-functions.\\
The meta information about the MPI-Application are stored in a project file.

\subsection*{Gathering Meta Information}
The project file holds information about accessed files by MPI-I/O, the 
process topology, used communicators and the MPI-datatypes. The information
are stored in a XML-based format.\\[2ex]

\subsection{Keeping track of I/O and communicators}


\subsubsection{Trace file format}
The trace file is an XML-based format. One element of the the XML file contains
one MPI function call.

\begin{figure*}

\begin{lstlisting}
<Send size='4' count='1' tid='1' toRank='1' toTag='1' cid='0'  time='0.910993'
end='0.911039'/>
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure*}


\section{HDReplay}
\label{intro-hdreplay}

HDReplay is a software tool which is capable of replaying the communication of an
MPI application. HDReplay reads the traces generated by HDMPIwrapper and replays
them using


HDReplay will create the necessary files be for starting the replay if the
original file dose not exists or can not be accessed. HDReplay will create
temporary files with the same size as the original one and fill it with random
data.

Paraweb is a community website


\section*{Performance Measuring and Comparison}
\label{performance}
This chapter will focus on the future work of HDReplay. In the previous chapter
Paraweb was introduced as a platform for scientists the distribute their trace
files. HDReplay will give the user the possibility to compare different traces 
to each other, this provides the comparison of different communication and I/O
pattern. But to provide this, there are some goals to accomplish.
