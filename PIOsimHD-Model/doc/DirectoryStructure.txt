Directory structure of the model and simulator: 

/mpiwrapper/
	Contains a C-PMPI Wrapper which is tested with MPICH2. (Experimental, yet unfinished)
	For each Program process it generates a single XML file and combines them into a large application.xml.	 
/xml-schema/
	Contains Schema Files for applications and for models. These should be referenced by all XML files.
/lib/
	Contains all required .jar files including their licenses
/images/
	Contains images for the GUI.
/src/
	Contains the Java SourceCode for the Model.

The SourceCode in the package de.hd.pvs.piosim is organized in the following packages:
tests/
	Contains Junit4.X tests.
model/
	Contains the Model
simulator/
	Contains the Simulator (Part of a different project)
gui/
	Contains the GUI for editing models.
	
The model package is organized as follows:
./
	Contains important model classes to read/write XML data and to verify the model.
annotations/
	Contains a set of Annotations which can be placed on fields or Methods.
	These Annotations are used during runtime to automatically read/write XML and to verify the 
	model. Due to the fact that these tasks do not occur frequently performance is not significant. 
components/
	Contains all logical objects of a cluster which have attributes and could be simulated.
	A computer (== Node) or a Network Interface Card for instance.
	All components form the model. 
interfaces/
	Contains global interfaces.
inputOutput/
	Contains helper classes for I/O related tasks. This includes distribution's. A distribution
	computes how data is distributed among existing I/O servers.   
program/
	A Client (== process) runs a particular program and collaborates in an application to achieve 
	a task. A process consists of a fixed sequence of complex operations (== commands) like a barrier.
	All code dedicated to a program and application can be found in this package. 	
util/
   	Contains several helper classes.
