Client Server I/O path:
	TODO use a new data structure to pick the best write operation depending on all pending requests
	   when it is really used.

Buffering of EagerProtokoll between two clients
   How does it work in MPICH?
   - Reserve a fixed amount in a client for each other client 
     (i.e. each client knows how much is free on a communication partner)
   - vs. consider an fixed amount RAM on the client as free cache (i.e. shared between clients)  
   - vs. estimate/know free cache on the communication partner.
